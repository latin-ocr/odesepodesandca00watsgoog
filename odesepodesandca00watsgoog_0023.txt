PREFACE. xi

¹sotnet'unes sofr and gentle Reproofs are to be made use of,
at other Times severe and home Reproofs. This is exacily the
ease with Horace and Juvenal: Horace wrote his Surrues in
the Reign of Augustus, when, tho’ Men were wicked, yet ¹
theyconceal’d their Vires, and affected to appear virtuous

tho’ they were not really so; to whom Horace suits his Sa-

when Men, encouragedl by the Example of a flagitious Ty-
rant‚ were openly and avowedly wicked; to remedy which,
*open and stinging Rebuhes were absolutely requifite. Where-
fore we may yustly conclude, that furii Satires as Juvenal's
would ,have suited Augustus Reign, as ill as Harace’s would
heve suited Domitian's. ·

As for Parus, who wrote in the Reign of the cruel Nera,
he is ailuw'd to be a good Satyrist, yet heis evidentlybe'-
neath both Horace and Juvenah· not only in his Nurube'ro,
but in the Purity of his Lara ς· which casaubon, his greatest
F avourer, can't help owning. He is also very obscure,
which some think he affected, others, that he was afraid of
Nara. But, after all, Perstat was hut a young Man, and¹
had not arrived to that Maturity‘of Judgtnent which· is ne·-
ceffary to make an accompliih’d ,Poet3 for he died before he
was thirty Years of Age3 wherefore‚ rather than search into
his F aulto, let us be surptizedtthat he wrote so welh·
