Fame sayS, inspired Orpheus first began i
To fing God'e Laws, and make ’em known to Man3
Their F ierceness sofren'd‚ sstow’d thern wholsome Food,
And frighten’d ΑΗ from lawless Lust and Blood:
And therefore Fame heth told, his charming Lote
Could tante a Lion‚ and correct aBtute.

Obedient Stones to make the Thebon Wall; 2

And danc'd in Order to the Tunes he play'd: ¹
’Tnas then the Workof Verse tomeke Men wit'e.
To‘lead to virtue, and to fright from Vice: ³
To make the Stvage pious‚ kind, end just3
To curb nniid Rege, and bind unlawful Lust;
To build Societies‚ and Fotce confine3

Verso recommends us to the Ears of Kings‚
And caseth Minds when clog'd with serious Things:
And therefore, Sir, ‚Verse may deserve yonr Cere,
Which Gode inspice, and Kings delight to hear.

in Love with Virtue and hate Vice3 and to that End lte ihews ¹
