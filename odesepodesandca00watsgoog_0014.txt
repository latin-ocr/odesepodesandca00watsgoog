D. Heinsttes affert, it had its Origin am'ong the Greeks, ‘and

³ that it takes its Name from the Greek Word Σατυρρῑ, a
mix'd kind of Animal, one of the rural Gods os the An·
tients.

On the other hand, Casaubon‚ Rigaltius, and Dacier,
affert its Origin to be entirely Roman, and that it takes its
Name from the Latin Word Satur, and that the Romans
wrote Satires lon before they had any Commcrce with
(ἕνεκα, of which uintilian leaves no'room to doubt, when

,Satur they made Satura, which they sometimes wrote Satira
with an i, as they did Maxumus or Maximus, and optumus
,or Optimus. Satura is an Adjeciive‚ and has Reference
jto the Substantive Lenx, which fignifies aCharger or
large Platter, fiil’d with all forts of fruit, which they
offered every Year to Ceres and Bacchus, as the Firttfnnes
of all they guthered3 which Custom of the Romans, and the
