Dnv. One Part os hlankind perfills with Conslancy in Vice,
and closely purlue their End: Not a scw swim with the strum,
sometimes elpousrng Virtue‚ sometimes srding with Vite. Priscus,
osten remarked with three Rings‚ * sometimes with none, lived so
various and inconsrslent, that he would shift his Robe every Hour:
From stately Apartments he would all os a suddn retire inroi'ime '
pitifus Hele, whence a decent F reed·Man † would be ahamed to
come abroad. μΝ ow he would chuse to live a Debauchee at Rome,
now a Virtuoso at Athens3 born under the inauspiciouslofluenceos
still-varying Vertumnus. ,

os his Euechos, had 1 disabled him in the Use os hit llands,
fl maintained an Hireling by the Day to take up the Dice sor him
and throw thern into the Box: The more heady this same F ellow ·
is in Vice, so much less is he miserable than the former, who =
fimetimes cleers, sometimes obrys' hir Pafflom, y as he who struggles
witha Rope one while struit, another while slac'lr. ¹

some Gotl suddenly reduce you to that State, you would be utterly
averse to it; either because you are not convinced that what you
make such Noise about is more eligible; or because you are not
firm in the Dese‘nee os Virtue, and, twith all your vain Efforts to
extricare your F eet out os the Mire, llill stick sast. At Rome you
long sor the Country: In the Country you are so sickle to exalt the
absent City to the Stare. Is you huppen to be no where invited out
to Supper, you are in Raptures with your quiet Mese os Herbe: '
And just as if you went by Compulhon, you ss thanlr your Stare,
