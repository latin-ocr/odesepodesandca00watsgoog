'x- PREFAGE.

Like him's the Lover‚ who laath ask’d in vain,
Doubting 'tse’er he lhou’d return again: · ,
Altho’ desrr’d, when he would gladly wait,
Ι Unalh’d, and linger at the hated Gate:
Now she inritet, and swears she will behind:
What, shall 130, or rather cure my Mindi
¹She lhut me out, rhen assis nte to return:
What, lsrall Ι go ?-No, tho’ she begs, I'll scurn.
But lu, his wiser Slaue ¹dld thus reprove:
Sir, Rtabn must be never us’d in Lover
.· lta Laws unequal, and its, Rules unfit,
For Love's a Thing by Nature opposite
, fTo common Reason, common Sense, and Wit;
All that’s in Lowe's unsteady‚ empty, ruint
There’s War and peace, and Peace, and· War again.
ι Now he that strives to lhttle such as these,
Mete Thingsof (hancce, and laithless as the Seu,
He were as good desrgn tobeafool .
By Art and Wisdonr, hnd bertrad by Rule.

, And in the Fr'rst Book os his Erucius, how diverting is the
Dialogue between Philip and Vulteius arena ; and the Story ’

os Lucullus’s Soldier in the Second ς not to mention the several
pretty little Fables, such as that 'of the Horse and the Book,
that of the F rogs, and that of the City and Country Mouse;
These and a hundred other Descriptions are set off in such a
delicate Manner, as must charm every Reader: But one need
transcribe the greater Part of the sai-rias and Errsrres,
tollosulblhlllhiblllldnllellltllller Horace or Juvenal excells in
Satire? Ican't see why both of them may'nt be Justly
praised, without detradling stom the Merit of either: They
¹ are both excellent in their Way, ·Horace in jocose, and Juve-
nal inserirur Satire·, each os which are undoubtedly necessary
according to theTempet of the People for whom they are
-del'rgned·, for, as in some Distempers lenitive Medicines are
to be applied, in others corrosrve; so in coueoingsice.
