· ’ onaan ,n nlnsnoemsnowswmsofa great a
H 9001, agreat Philosopher, and a great Critic3 but ¹

his Skill'in Philosophy aod Criticism appears more ¹
especially ln his Snomns and Enniano, in which he lays
down the best· Roles, not only to form the Tolle but the
Maamersof Youth: Nor does he in his Sn‘rms, while
'‘lllhvioe’ll‘ 'lllllsslislhlllllzilllh
h'hhzznande hhhes rhhen he is pointing outhe Truth to us,
an he hinpself says, Ridentem dicere perumpuid velam 'which
agrees with the Charalier Perstus gives o hun: ·

Omne vafer vitium ridenti, Flaccus amico ¹
Tangit ὅ admiffias circum pracordia ludia,

Callidus excuffo papulum suspendar< naso. ,

, He, with a lly, insinuating Gracc,
Laugh’d at his Friend‚ and look'd him in the Fam
Wou'd raise a Blulh where secret Vice he found, .
And tickle while he gently prob’d the Wound:
With seeming Innocence the Crowd begull’d,
And made ane desp’rate Pana when he smil’d.

But to understand ¹the Nature of Satine clearly, it will be .
necessary to enquire into its Origin, about which thero is so
great a contest among the critica. Julius Scaliger 21de
