§rur own gl'ezche13 yet take this Truth, which is worth our

emembrance ru spoken to you in particular: That in some iro·
feffionua Mediocrity, and atolerable Dezree may'weii enough be
admitted: ACounselior, sor example, or Pleader at the Bar, of the
middie' Rute, is iar from the Perfedhion of eloquent Medaia, nor

neither Godu, nor Men, nor uenul Columns, have given Irrduigence
to middlin Poets. As at amirthful Feast hurih discordant Mufick,

Honey, create Disgust3 because the Entertainment might have been
prolonged without them: So Poetry, by Nature dehgned and in·
