Ploughing3 chagrin’d with all these Losles, at Midnight he mounte‘
his Nag in a great Hurry3 and, quite out ot' Temper, melreo the

best of hisWay to Philip’s Seat. As soon ne Philip sees him, all '

rough and llovenly, Vulteius, says he, you seem to me to ssave too
much, and to be orersolicitous. ln truth, my Patron, says Vul-
teins, you ought to call me wretched, it' you would give me my
proper Nonne: Wherefore, by your Genius, your Right Hand,
and domestic Gods, 1 beseech, 1 conjure you, rellore me to my
former Condition. ’

Thus let the Man, who once hae found how much ¹ the Way of
Life he has quitted, is preferable to that which he has chose, forth·
with return, end re-allurne what he has lest: So reasonable isit,
that every Man lhould judge bis Seretion Zilis ‘limper ond capacity,
and measure himself by his own Sine and andnrd.
