Horace fligns ιἰι this Satire, that Damafippus, a Seoic Pb i,lq)'opher nabin
bin a Vfie ιἰι the County y, they bada Converstztion together. Damafippt

bmnnployed bime elf' ιιι cor reaing hisfirmer Works. orace receives h
Stoical Adviee with a great deal of Humum· and Pleastxntty. This Di u
logne furnisbes a mest agreeable Scene. One can find none that are noe
natural, or better carrie ed on, in Plato. Befides the Scene betwixe Hora<

three erfour Sorts qf E prsodes, which naturaely fall en the Way, and hav
a close Relation with the Su& ιέΐ. All that Damafippus and Stertiniu
say, is filled with excellent Precept53 and what I partie-ul rly admire is
that these Precepts confist, for the most Part, en sp ri gheb- and natur al Ex
